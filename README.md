# Notes on The Scrum Guide

**By [Ruben J. Sibon](https://www.scrum.org/user/294701)**

These are my notes on the official [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) that I made as part of a Professional Scrum Master (PSM-I) training by [The Liberators](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-liberators-15531047602).

Some parts of the guide may have been paraphrased or directly quoted in these notes without proper aknowledgement.

These notes may be expanded by me in the future. Pull requests are welcome!

## Empirical Process

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

## Scrum pillars

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaption

## Scrum values

- Commitment
- Courage
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect

When these values are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team the Scrum pillars come to life and build trust for everyone.

## The Scrum Team

### The Product Owner

- Decides what should be done.
- Optimizes the value of the work the Development Team does.
- Responsible for the Product Backlog.

### The Development Team

- Does the work to be done in a Sprint.
- Responsible for the Sprint Backlog.

### The Scrum Master

- Servant leader: facilitates and removes impediments.

## Scrum events

### The sprint (max 1 month; often 2 weeks)

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
- Quality goals do not decrease.
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated as more is learned.
- Can be cancelled (if continuing no longer makes sense).
- Starts immediatly after the previous sprint.
- Sprint Planning (max 8 hours for 1 month Sprints)
  - Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?
    - Development Team forecasts functionality that will be developed.
    - Product Owner discusses objective that the Sprint should achieve.
    - The Product Backlog is the input for the Sprint Planning. Only the Development Team can assess what items from the Product Backlog it can accomplish in the Sprint.
    - Formulation of Sprint Goal: provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.
  - Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?
    - The Sprint Backlog is the output of the Sprint Planning.
    - The Product Owner can provide clarifications.
    - People not in the Scrum Team may also be invited to provide technical or domain advice.
    - At the end of the Sprint Planning the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and the Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

### Daily Scrum (max 15 minutes)

- Plan work for coming 24 hours
- Team inspects progress towards Sprint Goal
- Adapts course as necessarry.
- Held at same time and place each day to reduce complexity
- Possible questions or discussion points:
  - What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
  - What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
  - Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
- Scrum Master ensures that the meeting takes place, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum.

### Sprint Review

- Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
- Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint.
- The Product Owner explains what has been “Done” and what has not been “Done”.
- The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into and how those problems were solved.
- The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands.
- The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
- Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next.
- Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality or capability of the product.

### Sprint Retrospective

- The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
- Purpose:
  - Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
  - Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements.
  - Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum Artifacts are pieces of work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts are designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.
Examples of Scrum Artifacts:
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Backlog
- Burn-Down Chart
- Increment

### Product Backlog

- The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.
- Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value. Product Backlog items often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when "Done".
- Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed.

### Sprint Backlog

- Set of Product Backlog items selected for a Sprint.
- Plus a plan for delivering a Product Increment.
- At any time the total work remaining in the in the Sprint Backlog can be summed.

### Increment

- The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.
- At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of "Done".

### Definition of “Done”

- Everyone must understand what “Done” means
- This is the definition of "Done" for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.
- If "Done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "Done" appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the Development Teams on all the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of "Done".

## About me and Scrum

My name is Ruben Sibon and I am a web developer who prefers to work in Scrum/Agile teams.

On February 2, 2018 I received the certification for Professional Scrum Master I with a 96.3% score on the [Scrum.org PSM-I](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-i-certification) assesment.

The course was paid from the education budget that I received from my very friendly employer [Saxum](https://saxum.nl/).
